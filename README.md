# Web scraper for PC Hardware prices

> This is a simple web scraper to search for the best price of PC Hardware parts on websites that sell and ship to M√©xico.

It works by searching for specific keywords of PC Hardware on the biggest M√©xico's websites. Then, it will show the best matches with the lowest prices available.
Mechanize with Nokogiri as dependency was used to fill search forms. And, Selenium to scrape websites (like Amazon) that require a real browser to visit their shop.

This is the list of distributors: 

	- MercadoLibre.com.mx
	- Cyberpuerta.mx
	- MiPC.com.mx

## üõ†  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
Depending on your distribution and, therefore your package manager, this commands may change. Here, Ubuntu is used as an example. 

##### ChromeDriver (required by Selenium WebDriver)
		 
	sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver

##### Install gcc compiler (required by Mechanize dependencies)
		
	sudo apt install build-essential

##### Ruby

Install libraries and dependencies:

	sudo apt install gcc make libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev

Install rbenv
		
	git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv

Add rbemv to your PATH

	echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
	echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
	exit

After the last step you need to open a new terminal to load the new PATH variables and run: 

	mkdir -p "$(rbenv root)"/plugins
	git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build

Finally, to make sure rbenv is installed, run:

	rbenv -v
		
Install Ruby

	rbenv install 2.7.0 --verbose

Verify everything is working and set global Ruby version as 2.7.0

	rbenv global 2.7.0

Verify Ruby version

	ruby -v

### Setup
####Install required gems for this project
This command will install Mechanize, Selenium WebDriver, Rspec, Rubocop and Simplecov gems:

	bundle install

### Usage
Include the following line at the top of your file:

	require './lib/scraper.rb'

Using 'RAM 16GB' as a search example. Run the scraper with the following: 

	web_scraper = Scraper.new('RAM 16GB')
	web_scraper.search

All search results will be saved on Scraper.Listing.products

	web_scraper.listing.products

Show the 30 cheapest products found:
		
	web_scraper.listing.find_cheapest


### Run tests
