# Web scraper for PC Hardware prices

> This is a simple web scraper to search for the best price of PC Hardware parts on websites that sell and ship to M√©xico.

It works by searching for specific keywords of PC Hardware on the biggest M√©xico's websites. Then, it will show the best matches with the lowest prices available.
Mechanize with Nokogiri as dependency was used to fill search forms. And, Selenium to scrape websites (like Amazon) that require a real browser to visit their shop.
